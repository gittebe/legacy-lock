# Legacy Lock 

Legacy Lock is a Virtual Time Capsule app that allows users to create and store messages or media (photos, videos, text) that are to be unlocked at a future date. 

Authentication ensures that only authorized people can access the content, providing a secure and personal experience for users to preserve memories or send time-locked messages.
