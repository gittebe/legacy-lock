# Legacy Lock 

Legacy Lock is a Virtual Time Capsule app that allows users to create and store messages or media (photos, videos, text) that are to be unlocked at a future date. 

Authentication ensures that only authorized people can access the content, providing a secure and personal experience for users to preserve memories or send time-locked messages.

## 🪝 Hooks  

### **Internal Hooks (Built-in React or Custom):**  
- **`useState`** – Built-in React hook for state management.  
- **`useEffect`** – Built-in React hook for handling side effects.  
- **`useMemo`** – Built-in React hook that stores the filtered and sorted capsule list to avoid recalculations on every render. 
- It filters out only future capsules (openAt > now), and sorts capsules in ascending order (soonest first).  
- **`useCapsuleStatus`** – Custom hook to calculate the time left on locked capsules.  
- **`useConfetti`** – Custom hook for handling the confetti effect.  
- **`useValidation`** – Custom hook to validate form fields in `CreateCapsule` form.  
 
### **External Hooks (from installed libraries):**
  - **`useNavigate`**– Comes from react-router-dom (for navigation)
  - **`useStore`** – Comes from zustand (global state management)
  - **`useRef`** - For file uploading using Cloud storage. 
  - **`useWindowSize`** – Comes from react-use. It dynamically gets the window width and height, ensuring that Confetti fills the entire screen.
    ```bash
    npm install react-use
    ```
