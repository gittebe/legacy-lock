# Final Project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

### ðŸ§  useMemo (in LatestLocket.jsx)
`useMemo` is a built-in React hook. 
  * - useMemo stores the filtered and sorted capsule list to avoid recalculations on every render.
  * - Filters out only future capsules (openAt > now)
  * - Sorts capsules in ascending order (soonest first)

### Shake effect (used in WarningPopup)
  ```bash
  npm install framer-motion
  ```
  
  The WarningPopup uses a shake effect to visually indicate that the capsule is not yet available.

  npm install react-confetti
  ```
  Triggered when the latest locket opens and runs for 6 seconds before stopping.

### useWindowSize
  ```bash
  import { useWindowSize } from "react-use";
  ```
  This hook dynamically gets the window width and height, ensuring that Confetti fills the entire screen.
